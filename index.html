            <li>You can create notes in HTML with <<!---->!-- Comments in here --></li>
            <li><<!---->!DOCTYPE_html> should declare the HTML document at the very first line on top</li>
            <li><<!---->meta charset="UTF-8" /> is a character set containing pretty much all character for any language, recommended in regular use for HTML5</li>
            <li>The head may contain <<!---->meta> tags like <<!---->charset> as well as <<!---->title> for the name of the webpage, <<!---->base> for defining a base URL, <<!---->link> to link to external resources, <<!---->script> for linking to scripts you want to use on the webpage, etc.</li>
            <li><<!---->link rel="stylesheet" href="directory or URL here" /> is used to link to a .css style sheet</br>
              &ensp;a directory of a file in a folder relative to where the html document is may look like "./assets/style.css"</li>
            <li><<!---->h1>Heading Here<<!---->/h1> is used for headings, where #1 can be 1-6 and should be only nested in order. This is important for accessibility in screen readers and SEO (search engine optimization)</li>
            <li><<!---->p id="name"> can be used to create an id for this individual element to apply styles in CSS, like a paragraph element here</li>
            <li><<!---->p class="name"<!---->> can be used to set an element as a class, which can be used to identify multiple elements, add class="name" to another element to apply a style to all at once in CSS, the other elements wouldn't have to be paragraphs necessarily</li>
            <li><<!---->a href="URL" target="#1-#4">text on screen<<!---->/a> can be used to create a hyperlink with text as the clickable element, where target can be...
              <ol>
                <li>_self = default target value, opens the link in the same window/tab as it was clicked</li>
                <li>_blank = opens in a new window or tab</li>
                <li>_parent = opens the doceument in the parent frame</li>

              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>To create an image hyperlink instead use the following, where #1-#4 are as above</br>
              <<!---->a href="URL" target="#1-#4"></br>
              &emsp;<<!---->img</br>
              &emsp;&emsp;src="./assets/img.png" **OR** src="URLhere"</br>

              &emsp;/><<!---->/a></li>

                <li>&<!---->emsp; = |&emsp;|</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><<!---->ol>List<<!---->/ol> can be used to create an ordered list</li>
            <li><<!---->ul>List<<!---->/ul> can be used to create an unordered list (bulleted list)</li>
            <li><<!---->li>List item<<!---->/li> is how to insert a list element into an ordered or unordered list</li>
            <li>Lists can be nested inside of each other to create subsections, you should nest a list inside of another list element</br>
              <<!---->li></br>
              &emsp;<<!---->ol></br>
              &emsp;&emsp;<<!---->li>List item<<!---->/li></br>
              &emsp;<<!---->/ol></br>
              <<!---->/li></li>
