# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project is an independent assignment to allow familiarization with multiple aspects of coding and workflow before starting the coding bootcamp it is for.
This was made to allow easy access to notes on the 4 subjects which are covered in the prework for bootcamp. These are HTML, CSS, Git & GitHub, and JavaScript
In taking time to build this site in the way it is, hopefully it will stay easy to update and relevant while learning coding or needing to remember important information at times.
The vocabulary section is split to allow a more easy to read and find definition for important words and concepts in each section. Code examples are shown below bulleted points to hopefully allow easy access to visualization of some of the most fundamental building blocks that will be used often.
I've learned how the different aspects of HTML can be effected by CSS and how JavaScript can be integrated to add more features or functionality to a project, and I hope to add to the arsenal so that I can make many useful things to come.

## Installation

This project is not a download itself you need, it can be viewed in a browser. If you would like to code or mess with the data used to build this project, you can follow these steps to get set up and ready to be a developer...
1.) Set up a GitHub account
2.) Download GitBash, and Visual Studio Code or another IDE
3.) Make a folder where your projects and repositories will go
4.) Set up SSH key on GitHub (refer to official GitHub documenation for [checking for keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) or [creating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent))
5.) Set Git [username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git#setting-your-git-username-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-email-address-for-every-repository-on-your-computer) for all or some repositories on your computer
6.) You can now clone this repository in Git (refer to GIT FLOW on the webpage) and mess with all the files and see how things work, as well as make your own GitHub linked repositories to track your work

## Usage

To use this study guide you can review all of the notes, as well as look at some of the background by hitting F12 or CTRL + SHIFT + I to see the HTML and console. In the console tab you will see a list of all the subjects we went over and a suggestion on what to study first.
